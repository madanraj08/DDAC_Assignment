        <hr />
        <p></p>
        <p>One of the best-known names in cruising, Princess Cruises first set sail in 1965 with a single ship cruising to Mexico. 
            Today, the line has grown to become the third largest cruise line in the world, renowned for innovative ships, an array of onboard options, and an environment of exceptional 
            customer service. A recognized leader in worldwide cruising, Princess carries 1.7 million guests each year to destinations around the globe ranging in length from three to 114 days, 
            allowing them to see the world and come back new.

        <p>Princess Cruises was catapulted to stardom in 1977 when one of its ships, Pacific Princess was cast in a starring role on a new television show called "The Love Boat." 
            The weekly series, which introduced millions of viewers to the concept of a sea-going vacation, was an instant hit and both the company name and its "seawitch" logo 
            have remained synonymous with cruising ever since.  The show, which can still be seen around the world, has been widely credited with fueling the dramatic expansion of the industry.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p style="font-size:120%"><b>A History of Innovation</b></p>
        <p>Since the line's beginnings, Princess has frequently paved the way in the cruise industry, evolving to meet the needs of the today's vacationer. In fact, a number of Princess concepts 
            have since been adopted by the entire cruise industry.</p>
        <p >The company has long been the leader in building ships specifically designed to accommodate an extensive number of the most sought-after shipboard luxury -- the private balcony. 
            In the 1980s Princess pioneered the concept of the affordable veranda, once an exclusive feature incorporated in only the most expensive suites. Today, Princess' fleet offers 
            one of the highest percentages of balcony cabins in the industry, across all cabin categories.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990s the company pioneered the concept of putting passengers in control of their own cruise experience with the introduction of a wide range of flexible onboard facilities,  
            amenities and services in order to create a personal vacation experience. The company also pioneered 24-hour dining with the first 'round-the-clock restaurant. Dining options were 
            further revolutionized in 2001 as Princess became the first cruise line to offer passengers a choice in their main dining room experience – either the traditional seating or a 
            restaurant-style Anytime Dining, in which diners could eat when and with whom they chose.</p>
        <p>
            Some other Princess innovations over the years include the first wedding chapel hosting modern-day weddings at sea; the unique Times Square-style Movies Under the Stars poolside 
            movie screen; and The Sanctuary, an adults-only oasis that has become exceedingly popular with passengers looking to relax.</p>
